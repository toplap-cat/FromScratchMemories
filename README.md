# From Scratch Memories

Collecting memories from the FromScratch sessions in Barcelona, which have been going on regularly (usually monthly, on the last Thursday of the month) since May 2018.

When we started FromScratch sessions, as mentioned in a [paper by Villasenor and Paz](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3939206), “the idea was to start the TOPLAP node with a live coding session using the same rules of the Mexico City sessions, to emphasize the writing of the code in real-time.” We knew that the nine-minute FromScratch format would be welcoming for newcomers; it is short, so there is no need to prepare a long set, and it provokes everyone, whether beginner or seasoned live coder, to make mistakes, so it serves to level the playing field. Most importantly, though, in that first session we invented the cardinal rule for our audience: All attendees must applaud at the end of nine minutes (remember that this is for fun). With applause guaranteed and errors not only accepted but appreciated, the FromScratch format lends itself as an ideal meetup activity for people with any level of live coding experience

If you remember something important, feel free to add (or ~~correct~~) it :)
